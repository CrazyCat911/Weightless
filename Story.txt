One day, Aaron was walking in the forest when he comes across a large red button. Aaron thought this was a good place to take a rest so he put his weight down onto the button and sat down. But the button got pressed by the weight (Aaron was strong, he could carry up to 90kgs at a time). The ground underneath him collapased, and he fell into a cave.
